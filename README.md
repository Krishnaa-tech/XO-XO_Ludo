## Game Rules:

1. When the game starts, all pawns are blocked at home, to release pawns, the player must roll 1 or 4 or 8.
1. Every player has a path to reach destination. So when the player gets a number, he/she must choose one of their released pawns and move it that many squares along the path.
1. Only one pawn can stand on a square except a safe square marked with a star. So if Player 1‚Äôs pawn stands on a square and Player 2‚Äôs pawn is moving to the same square then Player 2 pawn can kill Player 1‚Äôs pawn. Then, player 1‚Äôs pawn will go back to the starting square and get's blocked again.
1. When a player rolls 4, or 8 or kills the opponent's pawn, he/she will get another chance to roll.
1. Reaching the central square: A pawn must reach the central square exactly. For example, if a pawn is 3 squares away from the centre and the player throws a 4, that pawn cannot be moved.
